Hi, my name is Simon.

I'm a software developer currently living in Mannheim, Germany.

I like to read books (mainly crime and thrillers) and I can be a series addict.

I like to do sports and am a huge fan of Bayern Munich, but also support my local team Waldhof Mannheim.

Additionally to this website you can also check out my other online presences (see below).

Feel free to get in touch!
